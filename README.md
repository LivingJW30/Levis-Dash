## Development
This simple 2D game runs Python 3.10.9 using the PyGame library. I consider this my first personal coding project and though it took me some time to complete it, here it is! I relied heavily on the knowledge I gained from taking a college level Python course as well as tutorials and docs for pygame syntax and best practices. Throughout this project I was able to strengthen my Python knowledge and pick up new skills like Git and Windows command line. Though object oriented programming was not taught in the Python course I was able to learn and include classes to make life easier. Of course, no project goes without tribulation. I ran into a big problem with the reset button I implemented in the game. After debugging, I was able to fix it with an addition of a new variable and a whole lot of if statements. In the future I hope to up the complexitiy of my game and find a better way to distriute my game to friends.
## How to play it
If you would like to play this game without pulling this code follow the directions below:
1. Download the zip in the repo called: LevisDash.zip
   P.S. This is NOT malware! I would normally tell you to never download random zips/executables but all code and images included in this zip file are included on this repo so please check them if you would like.
2. Find the zip in your file system right click on it and press extract all.
3. A "Select a Destination and Extract Files" pop up should pull up. Confirm where you want to extract these files to on your system.
   Then press extract.
4. An "unzipped" file will show up now and your file system should pop up displaying a folder called "pygameexecute". Click on this folder.
5. You will now see all the files the zip included. Click on the executable called "Main", it should have a yellow snake on it. 
6. This should run the gam but let me know if you have any problems or questions!

NOTE: if any windows protection notices pop up click the "more options" pull down and the "extract anyways". The only reason this is popping up is because the zip is too big to be scanned by Windows. Don't worry, there are no viruses! I'm not smart enough yet to build my own malware.

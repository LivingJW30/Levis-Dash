## Development
This simple 2D game runs Python 3.10.9 using the PyGame library. I consider this my first personal coding project and though it took me some time to complete it, here it is! I relied heavily on the knowledge I gained from taking a college level Python course as well as tutorials and docs for pygame syntax and best practices. Throughout this project I was able to strengthen my Python knowledge and pick up new skills like Git and Windows command line. Though object oriented programming was not taught in the Python course I was able to learn and include classes to make life easier. Of course, no project goes without tribulation. I ran into a big problem with the reset button I implemented in the game. After debugging, I was able to fix it with an addition of a new variable and a whole lot of if statements. In the future I hope to up the complexitiy of my game and find a better way to distriute my game to friends.
